1. Installations

The necessary libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python Version 3.* are:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
plotly.express
seaborn (optional)

2. Project Motivation

This is the first project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program.
Fot the analysis I chose a publically available Dataset from Airbnb containing Data from Munich rentals.

The key Questions of the ananlysis are:
Which neighbourhoods are the most expensive in Munich?
The “Oktoberfest effect”: Is there a time in the year when rentals in Munich are very expensive?
Is this effect the same for all rentals in all neighborhoods in Munich?

This Project contains a jupyter notebook to showcsae all my work related to the three questions.

3. File Descriptions

aribnb_munich_analysis - contains the analysis

4. How to Interact with your project

The code can be seen in the jupyter notebook file.
The results of the analysis are presented on a Blogpost on Medium.com (https://medium.com/@markus.grueneis/the-oktoberfest-effect-3-findings-from-analyzing-the-munich-airbnb-dataset-683f829c19f4)
